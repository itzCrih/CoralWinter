## What will this do?
Assuming that you already have a snowy lobby, this plugin will let player break just the snow (it will get replaced some seconds later), which will give the player a snowball. Throwing the snowball at a player will hit them and apply knock back only if both players have the shovel or snowballs in their hands.
## Extra features
- Snowfall (basically snow particles) (only working if ProtocolLib is installed correctly).
- Shovel item, title and lore customizable in configuration.
- Break the snow blocks with a diamond shovel and get a snowball.
- Broken snow blocks will respawn after a few seconds. 
- PvP only enabled if you have a snowball in your hand.
- Santashovel command will give you a custom shovel with custom display name and lore.
- Break & place blocks protection included! (you can disable it on the config).

## FAQ
1. Why I don't see snow falling in the world? You have to install ProtocolLib in order to see that. Also, make sure you have optifine animations all enabled
2. How come I can break all the blocks with any tool? This plugin was invented to be placed in a lobby, so you need to make sure you have a core that limits block breaking or enable block protection from the configuration.
