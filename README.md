## FAQ
1. Why I don't see snow falling in the world? You have to install ProtocolLib in order to see that. Also, make sure you have optifine animations all enabled
2. How come I can break all the blocks with any tool? This plugin was invented to be placed in a lobby, so you need to make sure you have a core that limits block breaking. You will see that you can only break blocks of snow with a diamond shovel.
