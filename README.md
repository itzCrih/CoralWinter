## Install
To install the plugin follow the steps below. 
1. Download `CoralWinter.jar` from repository's release;
2. Put the jar into your plugins folder. 
3. Start your server and have fun!
## FAQ
1. Why i don't see snow falling in the world? You have to install ProtocolLib in order to see that. Also, make sure you have optifine animations all enabled
2. How come I can break all the blocks with any tool? This plugin was invented to be placed in a lobby, so you need to make sure you have a core that limits block breaking. You will see that you can only break blocks of snow with a diamond shovel.
